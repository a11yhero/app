It helps users who need larger text for better readability. It also accomodates those who can read smaller text, allowing more information to appear on the screen.

Apps that support Dynamic Type also provide a more consistent reading experience.";

About.dynamic.colors = "Dynamic Colors adapt automatically to the underlying interface style. Light and dark interfaces use very different color palettes. Colors that work well in a light appearance may be hard to see in a dark appearance, and vice versa. An adaptive color object returns different color values for different interface styles.

When configuring UI elements, choose semantic colors which convey the intended use of the color, rather than specific color values. When you use them for their intended purpose, they render with color values appropriate for the current settings.";

They’re not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo; you can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things, they push the human race forward.

And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.";
